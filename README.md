Our Vision

K0 net most popular ten thousand times the coin Musk brother attention shout single blue stocking

Kill0 (K0 for short) is a community project that was only recently launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). 
The cryptocurrency has the largest number of zeros in history, with 77 zeros in total. 
It's a zero-killing game, it's a zero-going experiment (with bonus SHIB features), even though the token supply is extremely high, with a net maximum of 1E77. 

It jumped 100 times the first day of trading and 1,000 times the next day

Our goal is to KILL0 three 0's five 0's ten 0's and see how many 0's we can kill

To enhance user trust, developers give up contractual ownership and the pool is locked in for 34 years.
